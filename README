This library is based on work of Markus Feindler, Le Xuan Trun and Kristina B. Taylor 
(see http://code.google.com/p/tapestry5portlet/ for more details).

Like Felix Scheffer (http://code.google.com/p/tapestry5-portlet-support/ for more details), 
we have updated the dependencies of this library to use Tapestry 5.2.6  and higher version.  

This library also support:
- portlet event processing (JSR 286)
- serving ajax request as portlet resource (event name that start with serve or components declared in the PortletResourceResponseIdentifier service)
- support MARKUP_HEAD_ELEMENT
- rework on IdAllocator to avoid conflict for generated id when there is more than on tapestry portlet in a page. 
- use of Apache Pluto to ease the test
